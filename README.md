# tictacgo
Small tic-tac-toe application in [Go](https://golang.org/) to explore some concepts

This is the first thing I wrote in Go after taking a coursera course on it so I'm sure some improvements could be made.

TODO:
- Allow user to choose algorith
- Allow user to choose whether he's X or O
- Algorithm improvements
- Play around with parallel execution
- Display the winning row
- Prevent clicks after a player has won
- Write some tests
- Add some instructions in the README.md
